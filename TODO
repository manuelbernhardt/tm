== view / javascript

try out and create simplified ways of using the following widgets:
- modal windows
  --> ideally wrap it in some custom tag
- collapsible div
- date picker
- charts
- timeline widget
- select many (like facebook)
== Components ==

JSTree

- make a tag out of the view code

- implement a way to configure the tree behavior regarding object deletion and copying
- finish implementing the unit test

- implement full example with root, folder, file
  - featuring multi-tree operations
- add indexes on the model
- query optimization: simplified version of Model.findById() that does not retrieve all the fields but only a given list.

after discussion:
- abstract the JPA implementation (including entities):
  - "cascade to object" --> cascade to object (delete, copy) active, and mappings in entities
  - "don't cascade to object"

- improve keyboard navigation?
